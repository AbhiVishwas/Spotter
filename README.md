# Spotter
Find the Sweet Spot with your Study Spot

## Inspiration

> How did it get so late so soon? It’s night before it’s afternoon. December is here before it’s June. My goodness how the time has flewn. How did it get so late so soon? -  Dr. Seuss

Time is one thing my father said to save, and it was resonated through the Dr.Seuss he read to me at night. That lesson only made half sense back then, but now responsibilities have come. Along with the struggles with juggling 5 classes, a job, and extracurriculars, I realized that many students face the same issue. We try to trick ourselves into thinking were in good, distraction-free zones, when we are often subconsciously distracted by either comfort or other things in the environment. Good study habits are the base of productive and successful students, and knowing this, Spotter was created

## What it does

Spotter is mainly meant to find the ultimate study spot. Students can enter preferences like wifi speed needs, noise levels, space requirements, power, all things critical to student success in study spaces. On top of this, Spotter focuses on reviews from students, rating the above items, and making sure that you are getting the best places to have your next study jam. 

Then, Spotter allows you to seamlessly integrate your day in your dashboard, fully customizable and allowing for easy access to your day and week plans, along with larger tasks if needed. Creating tasks and tracking them is easy, as Spot (our furry friend), helps to track your progress as he runs and gets tired when you finish. With the planned help of APIs in the future, Spotter will see integration with popular sites like Dropbox, Notion, and Google drive, making it the only stop students will need for their studies.
